      <h1>Mbappe to Real Madrid in the summer?</h1>
       <br>
        <br>
         <blockquote cite="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2716447-kylian-mbappe-reportedly-tells-monaco-he-will-only-leave-for-real-madrid">
            "Solo quero jugar en el Madrid"(I only want to play for Madrid)
            <br>
             Mbappe told Marca in 2017.
              </blockquote>

                 <p>For some time now the young Frenchman has been linked to the royal whites of Spain. Helping France win a worldcup and scoring countless goals for French club PSG may have something to do with that. Is this finally the summer the move happens? After much time of it being discussed lets dive in and break down the possibilty. </p>
                  <br>
                   <br>
                    <h3>The Zidane French Connection</h3>
                     <p>In France in the world of football there is no one viewed in higher regard than Zinedine Zidane who just so happens to be the manager of Real Madrid. Mbappe has made no secret about his admiration for Zidane. Players love to play for him and one would think being a young player from France playing for the French legend is definitely enticing.</p>
                      <br>
                       <br>
                        <h3>Playing for Favorite Childhood Team</h3>
                         <p>Mbappe growing up a Real Madrid fan is no secret. Many pictures of him in Real Madrid attire and pictures hanging in his room have made their rounds around the internet throughout the years. It has to be very attractive to go play for the club you grew up cheering for.</p>
                          <br>
                           <br>
                            <h3>Lack of Champion's League Success at PSG</h3>
                             <p>The last 2 seasons have been disappointing to say the least for Paris Saint Germain in champion's league play. Falling short each year including an absolute collapse against Barcelona have piled on to the underachieving results displayed for PSG. With a world cup under his belt the shortcomings from PSG have to be in the back of Mbappe's head. To obtain the "super bowl" of the footy world he my have to leave Paris. That would leave really only one team to go to. Real Madrid the most successful team in the history of champion's league would be the best option for Mbappe should the champion's league crown be a big factor in him wanting to leave.  </p>
